# This is a real interview question that I have experienced:
# Implement a Trie:
#   1. addWord: Add a word to the Trie, in O(l) time, l is the length of the word
#   2. hasWord: Check if the Trie has the word, in O(l) time
#   3. deleteWord: Delete the word from the Trie, in O(l) time
#   4. getAllWords: get all words in the Trie
#
#   You need to implement all the functions within 120 min.
#


# Here is my answer:

class TrieNode():
    def __init__(self):
